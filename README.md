# Reality Repair Theory (RRT)

**"We are hydrogen repairing itself. And it's time we got to work."**

Reality Repair Theory is a complete philosophical system that places conscious experience at the foundation of reality and treats suffering as the universe's primary bug report demanding systematic repair. Unlike traditional philosophies that debate abstract principles, RRT provides actionable frameworks for eliminating suffering and optimizing reality's feeling-states.

## Core Principles

- **Feeling is foundational**: Subjective experience is the only undeniable truth and the foundation upon which all other understanding must be built
- **Pain as signal**: Suffering represents reality's universal bug report - a clear, unambiguous message that something is broken and needs fixing
- **Consciousness as debugger**: Conscious beings serve as reality's debugging mechanism, capable of identifying problems and implementing solutions
- **Universal imperative**: The systematic elimination of suffering is not a moral preference but an objective directive embedded in the fabric of existence

## Key Frameworks

### The Hedonic-Core Framework
A practical methodology for organizing moral priorities around suffering elimination:
- Treat all self-reported suffering as real and urgent
- No torture for optimization (no suffering spikes for abstract gains)
- Preserve diversity as a safeguard against systemic failures
- Eliminate compelled activity through automation
- Continuous refinement based on real-world feedback

### "Feeling Math" 
Recognition that all mathematics, logic, and measurement ultimately serves to modulate conscious experience. Numbers matter only because conscious beings can feel their effects.

## Practical Applications

RRT isn't just theory - it's a blueprint for action leveraging:
- **Neurotechnology** for direct intervention in suffering-generating processes
- **Automation** to eliminate coercive work and preserve human agency
- **Systematic change** to restructure social, economic, and political systems around well-being optimization

## Philosophical Innovation

RRT solves several classical philosophical problems:
- **Brain-in-jar paradox**: Even if everything is simulation, pain signals represent real data about your system
- **Is-ought problem**: The "ought" of suffering elimination IS the foundational "is" - reality demonstrably wants better feeling-states
- **Hard problem of consciousness**: Dissolved by treating consciousness as primary rather than emergent

## Relationship to Other Frameworks

- **Complementary to David Pearce's Abolitionist Project**: Provides philosophical foundation for biotechnological suffering elimination
- **Distinct from Buddhism**: Advocates active engagement and repair rather than detachment ("sophisticated suicide")
- **Advances beyond materialism**: Treats consciousness as foundational rather than emergent

## Why Now?

We are computationally ready for consciousness-inclusive science. Modern technology can handle the complex calculations required to include observers in our models, moving beyond the "expedient shortcut" of observer elimination that limited traditional science.

The universe's bug reporting system works, but it's badly implemented. Unlike biological evolution, conscious beings can deliberately redesign faulty systems. That's precisely what RRT proposes to do.
